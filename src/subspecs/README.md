# Subspecs Directory

This directory contains sub-specifications that extend or modify the main specs.

Place your sub-specification modules here, such as:
- EIP implementations
- Feature-specific changes
- Experimental specifications
- Network upgrades

Sub-specifications typically import and extend types from the main `specs` directory.
