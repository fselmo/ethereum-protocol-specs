# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for the project.

## setup.py

This script is used to initialize a new project from the template. It will:

1. Prompt for project configuration (name, author, etc.)
2. Replace all template placeholders in the project files
3. Prepare the project for development

After running this script, it should be deleted as it's no longer needed.

```bash
python scripts/setup.py
```
